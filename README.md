# sequence-diagram
A tool for creating simple ASCII sequence diagrams, like so:

```
alice               bob                 charlie

apple pie---------->

                    [smiles]

[smiles]

                     <------------------money

 <------------------paycheck

[contemplates life,
the universe, and
everything]

a complex poem of
intricate concepts--------------------->

                    a giant hotdog-
                    shaped car and two
                    chocolate bars----->

                                        [nirvana]
```

This is a local implementation, so you don't risk leaking IP as in online UML solutions.
